# FastBlazorTheme
 Razor component library that bundles the styling and JavaScript for multiple Blazor WebAssembly and Blazor Server projects. I am trying to achieve same look and feel for all of the Blazor projects, so the razor component libraries contains the css and JS to initialize the fast design system provider and update baseLayerLuminance to achieve dark (0.23), light (1) modes .
